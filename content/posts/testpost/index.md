## Overview  

**Quranntino** is an innovative **Indoor Positioning and Geofencing System** designed to monitor Covid-19 patients within hospital premises. The system utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) bands and strategically placed receivers to ensure real-time tracking of patients. If a patient attempts to breach the geofence or remove the band, an instant alert is sent to hospital authorities via a web application.  

This solution was developed to support frontline healthcare workers by improving patient monitoring, security, and resource allocation during the pandemic.  

**Key Technologies Used:**  
- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons** for tracking  
- **ESP32 microcontroller** for smart wearable bands  
- **Firebase Authentication & Real-Time Database**  
- **Dynamic Web Application** with an intuitive UI

## Features  

**Geofencing Alert System:** Triggers instant alerts if a patient tries to exit the geofenced zone.  
**Health Monitoring:** Tracks vital parameters (temperature, pulse) through wearable bands.  
**Dynamic & Responsive Web Application:** Provides real-time tracking and visualization for hospital administrators.  
**Secure Authentication:** Uses Firebase Auth to restrict unauthorized access.  
**Low Power Consumption:** Optimized battery usage for continuous operation.

## System Architecture  

Our approach involved multiple layers of data collection, processing, and visualization:

1️. **Data Collection**  
   - BLE receivers track patient movement.  
   - Wearable bands measure temperature & touch sensor activity.  

2️. **Real-time Data Processing**  
   - Firebase stores & analyzes live patient data.  
   - Alerts are triggered instantly upon any policy breach.  

3️. **Visualization & Dashboard**  
   - Hospital authorities monitor live location & alerts via a secure web app.
